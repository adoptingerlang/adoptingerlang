Adopting Erlang is an ongoing effort to gather all the resources that will help you use Erlang in a business. The booksite is divided in three sections focusing particularly on Erlang/OTP's higher level concepts in the current open source ecosystem, how to use it in production (while setting up a pipeline for continuous development and delivery), and how to build a team when you're starting from scratch.

The booksite is currently a work in progress, and updates will regularly be posted, aiming for a chapter per month. You can come back here to check for new material, or follow the authors on social media to get notifications, at least until we add some RSS Feed in here.
