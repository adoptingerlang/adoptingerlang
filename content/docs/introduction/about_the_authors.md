## Tristan Sloughter {#tristan-sloughter}

Tristan is a long time Erlang programmer, having picked it up for fun while in
college and then professionally for various companies, Orbitz Worldwide,
eCDMarket, Heroku, SpaceTime Insight, Postmates, Splunk and currently as a lead
software engineer at [MyDecisive.AI](<https://www.mydecisive.ai/>).

While at Heroku, Tristan, along with Fred, started the build tool Rebar3 after seeing the struggles involved in onboarding new developers to Erlang projects. He is also a maintainer of the release tool Relx.

Tristan also created the website [How I Start](https://howistart.org/) which collects articles for various languages from experienced developers on how they setup a new project and take it to completion, while also giving a peek at the tools and packages these top developers prefer.
